<h1 align="center">Twitter Analysis on HS2</h1>

## Motivations
Employing Twitter's new API (v2), this Jupyter Notebook extracts tweets about UK's High Speed Rail II (HS2), analyses the tweets' locational data and Twitter metrics (e.g. likes, retweets), and conducts sentiment analysis to better inform the overall popularity of the project, views on specific decisions and local opinions.  This is only used as a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential power of these analysis to inform clients about the success of a projects' community engagement strategies, improvements that need to be considered and tasks/locations that clients should focus on.
